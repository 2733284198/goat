# Contributing

So you want to contribute to Goat? Great!

Here's a small guide to make this easy for everyone:
1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch named after your addition (e.g. `my-awesome-feature`)
3. Write many tests (the coverage shouldn't fall)
4. Create pull request

Thank you! :heart:
